# Docker Compose

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. Using a YAML file, you can specify the services, networks, and volumes for your application. Docker Compose simplifies the process of running and coordinating multiple containers as a single service.

## Key Concepts

- **Service**: A container in your application. Each service runs one image and can be scaled by specifying the number of container instances.
- **Network**: Allows communication between services. By default, Docker Compose creates a network for the containers in the same Compose file.
- **Volume**: Persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are stored on the host filesystem and can be shared among containers.

## Benefits

- **Simplifies Multi-Container Management**: Easily manage multiple containers using a single configuration file.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all developers and CI environments run the same application configurations.
- **Scalability**: Scale services up or down with a single command.

## Basic Usage

**Define the Application in `docker-compose.yml`**:

```yaml
services:
    web:
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
            - "80:80"
    db:
        image: postgres:alpine
        environment:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

**Start Your Application**:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Stop Your Application**:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
